# Traffic-Signs-Image-Classification
Traffic Sign Classification Using CNNs
---
- Building a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras with Tensorflow as a backend
- image normalization and convert from color-scaled to gray-scaled images.

General codes/numbers for various images given at the beginning of the notebook for reference and train data needs to be extracted on the given location if you wanna try it out.
